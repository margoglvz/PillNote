# PillNote

### Welcome to my very first personal project! As someone who is passionate about health and technology I wanted to make an app that aligned with my interests.

### This is where **PillNote** comes in!

**Background**: I am someone who is a bit hesitant when taking prescriptions as I know why I am taking them, but I do not know how they are going to affect my body or how they specifically make my body help my symptoms. Other people I know have also shared that feeling and that is why I decided to create PillNote.

**About**: PillNote is an app that allows you scan your prescriptions and it will tell you certified information on how this prescription
affects your body and how it helps you. It also alerts the user of any possible allergies and keeps updating the user on how they are feeling with their
prescription.

**Result**: This allows more independent health tracking for the user and allows them to take more charge in their prescription health.
